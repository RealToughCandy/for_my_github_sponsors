# for_my_github_sponsors
A quick but important note for my GitHub sponsors.

My first emotion when I get a notification from GitHub about a new sponsor:

# Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

My _second_ emotion when I get a notification from GitHub about a new sponsor:

## I wish I could contact these peeps. :(

Understandably, GitHub doesn't allow me to contact my sponsors directly. (I'm only allowed to send email updates with the option of segmenting by tier level -- not individual.) 

However, some of my tiers do include a physical or digital reward that requires a mailing and/or email address.

**If you are on a sponsorship tier with rewards that requires a shipping address/email address and would like to claim your goodies:** Please send me an email at realtoughcandy at gmail dot com. Let me know you're my GitHub sponsor and we will get everything in gear! 

Code on and prosper!
